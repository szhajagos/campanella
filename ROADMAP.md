# Roadmap

Campanella evolves in small steps: every feature gets its own version, with
its own tests, documentation and CHANGELOG entry. Since 0.1.0 (the first
milestone, 2026-10-08) a real website can be run and managed from the
browser; the next versions are 0.1.x (fixes) and 0.2.0, 0.3.0 … (features).

The roadmap is a direction, not a promise: the order may change based on experience.
Completed changes are listed in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Done

| Version | Contents |
|---|---|
| 0.0.1 | Object model, Capability contract, Blueprint, Query, access-aware queries, Twig rendering, CLI |
| 0.0.2 | Relations (relationships): article → categories, `whereRelated`, `RelationLoader`, Blueprint lists |
| 0.0.3 | Users and login: `Identifiable`, `Authenticatable`, `Authorable`, session, CSRF, login throttling, `LoginGuard` + honeypot, `editor` role, `user:*` commands; MIT license |
| 0.0.4 | Admin UI (lists, generated forms, publishing incl. scheduled, deleting), multi-valued fields (cardinality), translation layer (en, hu), Bootstrap 5.3 shipped locally, themes |
| 0.0.5 | HTML editing: System page, HTML allowlist filter on every save, Jodit editor (shipped locally), Content-Security-Policy for the admin, image upload (checked by content, re-encoded, `image` Blueprint, Images list) |
| 0.0.6 | Migrations: reading and comparing the schema (`schema:check`), migrations with built-in backups (`migrate`, `db:backup`), upgrading from the browser (`/admin/upgrade`), the definitions' additive changes applied automatically, roles as a multi-valued field |
| 0.0.7 | Trees and menus: `Weighted` and `Hierarchical` (materialized path, no circles, at most 10 levels), trees in the admin (indented, up/down), the category tree on the site (breadcrumbs, articles of subcategories), menus edited in the admin (`menu`, `menu_item`, `Link` with safe URLs, `Keyed`, separate trees per menu), `menu()` in templates |
| 0.1.0 | First milestone: installing from the browser (`/install`, with a key), users in the browser (administrators manage them; everyone's profile and password; sessions end on a password change), ready for a public server (trusted proxies, Content-Security-Policy and other headers, System page checks, deployment guide), Blueprints and capabilities in the admin (read-only), a security review (template sandbox, login throttling, fail-closed `.htaccess`, `composer audit` in CI); upgrades from 0.0.6 on |
| – | Continuous integration (GitHub Actions): PHPStan, documentation, tests on MariaDB 10.6/11.4 and MySQL 8.0/8.4; installation package with `vendor/` for every version tag |

## Next

To be planned together, from the *Later* list below. Candidates: site basics
(meta description, sitemap.xml, robots.txt), a forgotten password by e-mail
(with e-mail sending and the Event / Action system), image variants and an
image picker, site settings edited in the admin, the session list.

## Later

- **Event / Action / Workflow:** events (`ObjectPublished` …), operations
  bound to them (e-mail, webhook), a state machine for publishing.
- **Component / Region / Layout / Page:** assembling pages from components,
  instead of Drupal-style blocks.
- **Webform:** forms as a user interface for object operations.
- **Comments** (2026-10-07), after the Webform and the Event system (they need
  moderation and protection against spam): a `comment` Blueprint (`Textual`,
  `Authorable`, `Publishable` for moderation) with a required `subject`
  relation to the commented object, **not** a parent: the commented object is
  of another Blueprint. Replies form a tree with `Hierarchical`, among the
  comments of the same subject; ordered by time, not by weight. A
  `Commentable` capability on the commented Blueprints (comments open or
  closed, the count).
- **Cache:** object, query and render cache with cache tags and contexts.
- **JSON API** according to the [HTTP API draft](docs/http-api/README.md).
- **Media:** file storage, image variants (thumbnails, sizes for `srcset`),
  and tracking where an image is used (e.g. a relation filled from the texts
  on save), so the delete page can list those texts, and an image picker in
  the editor (choosing an uploaded image).
- **Site basics** (moved out of 0.1.0, 2026-10-08): `<meta name="description">`
  from the lead, canonical URLs, `sitemap.xml` of the public content,
  `robots.txt`.
- **Forgotten password by e-mail** (after e-mail sending; user management
  itself comes in 0.1.0).
- **Blueprints defined in the admin** (until then: `config/blueprints.php`).
  Every object stays in `objects`; the question is only where a custom field
  of such a Blueprint is stored. A per-field (or per-Blueprint) setting
  decides (2026-10-04):
  - *not queryable*: in the `data` JSON column (as custom fields are now);
  - *queryable* (filtering, sorting, indexes): in a table of its own. Either a
    table generated for the Blueprint (its own columns; needs the migration
    system of 0.0.6, because the admin would change the database schema), or
    the shared typed value table (`cc_field_values`), which needs no schema
    change at all. To be decided when the feature is planned.
  - Order: after the migrations (0.0.6), because every change also affects
    the existing content.
  - Operations: creating and modifying Blueprints; choosing capabilities from
    the installed ones (adding one is applied to the existing objects too;
    removing one keeps their data); custom fields; labels, form order,
    defaults, editor profile.
  - Blueprints from `config/blueprints.php` would appear as protected ("defined
    in code"); those created in the admin would be fully editable.
  - New kinds of capabilities stay code (they carry behaviour): they come from
    modules, not from the admin.
- **Multilingual content.**
- **Search**, URL aliases and redirects, trash, audit log.
- **Login extensions:** two-factor authentication (e.g. TOTP) as its own
  capability, inserted between password verification and logging in;
  additional `LoginGuard`s (CAPTCHA); password reset by e-mail (after
  Event/Action and mail sending); listing sessions and logging them out.

## Accepted decisions

- **License: MIT** (2026-09-29). Only dependencies with MIT-compatible licenses
  may be used (MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0, etc.); no GPL.
- **PHP 8.3** is the minimum; the common subset of MariaDB 10.6+ / MySQL 8.0+.
- **Look and feel: Bootstrap 5.3** for the admin UI and the default theme,
  shipped locally, with a replaceable theme (2026-09-29).
- **WYSIWYG: Jodit**, only the free MIT edition; PRO is not an option. If an
  important feature is only available in PRO and cannot be replaced with our
  own plugin, the fallback is SunEditor (2026-09-29). Submitted HTML is always
  sanitized by the server, independently of the editor.
- **No jQuery-dependent components.**
- **Multi-value fields:** a field's cardinality is defined on the `Field`;
  queryable multi-value fields live in the shared `cc_field_values` table, and
  we never search in JSON (2026-09-29). Anything that refers to another thing
  (tag, image, author) is an object and a relation, not a multi-value field.
- **HTML content (0.0.5):** sanitized on save at the lowest layer; only our
  own uploaded images; uploaded images are re-encoded (with GD) and are objects
  (2026-10-02).
- **System page:** the admin's "System" menu checks the server's requirements;
  administrators only, and it never shows secrets (2026-10-02).
- **Secure by default (2026-10-04):** Campanella is built for the public, not
  for one server. The defaults must be safe for someone who changes nothing
  (e.g. strict image handling, HTML filtering, no default accounts); a weaker
  option needs an explicit setting, documented with its risk. Until 0.1.0 a
  documented gap is acceptable (parts 1 and 5 of 0.1.0 close them); from 0.1.0
  on, a release is not made with a known open security gap.
- **Migrations (2026-10-05):** forward only, no rollback: a backup before
  migrating instead (`db:backup`, built in). Additive changes from the
  definitions are applied automatically; renaming, type changes, moving or
  deleting data only through an explicit migration, never by guessing. Upgrades
  can be run from the browser too, for web hosts without a command line.
- **Trees (2026-10-07):** a parent is always in the same Blueprint; a node
  with children cannot be deleted; the depth is at most 10. A relation to an
  object of another kind (e.g. a comment and its article) is a relation, not
  a parent.
- **Language:** code, documentation, comments, commit messages and
  developer-facing messages are English; the UI is multilingual via the
  translation layer, with Hungarian as a first-class translation (2026-09-30).
